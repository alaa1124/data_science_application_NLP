data is a Pandas DataFrame that contains partitions of text and their corresponding labels from multiple books in the Gutenberg corpus. Each row represents a partition, and the columns are "partitions" and "label".

It downloads the NLTK punkt tokenizer by calling nltk.download('punkt'). This tokenizer is used for tokenizing text into individual words or sentences.

It sets the variable en_stops to a set of English stopwords from the NLTK stopwords corpus.

The code downloads the Gutenberg corpus from NLTK by calling nltk.download('gutenberg'). The Gutenberg corpus contains a collection of literary works.

It retrieves the file IDs of the texts in the Gutenberg corpus by calling gutenberg.fileids() and prints them.

The code imports the gutenberg corpus from NLTK once again.

It assigns the file IDs of the Gutenberg corpus to the listBooks variable and prints the list.

It retrieves the raw text of a specific book from the Gutenberg corpus using the nltk.corpus.gutenberg.raw() function and assigns it to the book variable.

The code tokenizes the book using a regular expression pattern with regexp_tokenize from NLTK, which splits the text into words of length 2 or more. The resulting tokens are assigned to the toknize_book variable.

It calculates the length of toknize_book using the len() function.

The code uses regular expressions (re.findall()) to find words of length 2 or more followed by a whitespace or a period (.) in the book. The matches are returned as a list.

The code defines a function named read_book that takes a name parameter (file ID) and performs the following steps:

Reads the raw text of the book using nltk.corpus.gutenberg.raw().
Tokenizes the book using regexp_tokenize with the same regular expression pattern as before.
Creates an empty list named list_of_part.
Iterates 200 times, generating a random starting position within the range of the tokenized book and selecting 100 tokens from that position. These 100 tokens are joined with spaces to form a partition of text.
Appends the partition and the label (obtained by removing the ".txt" extension from the name) to list_of_part as a dictionary.
Converts list_of_part into a Pandas DataFrame with two columns: "partitions" and "label".
Returns the DataFrame.
The code creates an empty DataFrame named data.

It defines an empty DataFrame named df1.

The code iterates over each name in listBooks (file IDs of the Gutenberg corpus) and performs the following steps:

Calls the read_book function with name as the parameter, which returns a DataFrame.
Appends the DataFrame df1 to data using the append() method with ignore_index=True to maintain continuous index values.
